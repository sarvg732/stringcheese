Welcome to String Cheese Pizzeria!


You will be able to purchase a pizza using your ASU ID and account through this application created by our team. Simply sign-in on the Login page, or choose to
sign-in later, and then go through the pizza types and toppings to build your pizza. You will be taken to a Checkout page, which will show you the pizza you made, and 
will also display the total cost and tax added to your order. Afterwards, you can confirm the order and pay for the pizza using different payment methods displayed on the
Payment page. If you clicked "Sign-in Later" on the Login page, you will be required to put your ASU ID before being able to view the payment options.


The distribution of the team work goes as follows:
 - Login page: Rishabh (team manager)
 - Pizza Type/Toppings: Anush
 - Checkout: Krisha
 - Payment (if already logged in): Sarva (team leader)
 - Payment (if not logged in yet): Andrew (requirements tracker)
